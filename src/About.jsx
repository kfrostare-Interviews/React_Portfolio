            I am 34 years old living in Stockholm with my husband with whom I travel a lot as this is our shared passion. 
            During our travels I love taking photos of people, places, animals or just amazing scenery. My name is Karolina
            but please say Karro.</p>
            
            <h2>Passion number three</h2>

            would be to create for the underdog, the small businesses who don't themselves have the time to dive into 
            details like the look and feel of a business card or a website. I enjoy finding people with talent and helping them out with their
            marketing in exchange for their story. The most amazing thing is when you ask a small-business owner to tell you their journey. 
            The story you'll hear is one of sacrifice in blood, sweat and tears to make their dream come true. And most importantly they will
            speak of the love they have for the profession. After that, helping them create an app or design a business card in line with their 
            brand is in a way to be part of their journey and dream. So rewarding and amazing!
