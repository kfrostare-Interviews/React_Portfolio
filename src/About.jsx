            I am a 30-somethin' year old living in Stockholm with my husband, with whom I travel a lot as this is our shared passion. 
            During our travels I love taking photos of people, places, animals or just beautiful scenery. My name is Karolina
            but please say Karro. 
          </b></p>

            Passion number three would be to create for the underdog, the small businesses who don't themselves have the time to dive into 
            details like the look and feel of a business card or a website. In my spare time I enjoy finding people with talent and helping 
            them out with their marketing in exchange for me to be a part of their story. Helping them create an app or design a business 
            card in line with their brand is in a way to be part of their journey and life long dream. That, to me, is so rewarding!
