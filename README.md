*This portfolio was created using React, click on the title to get there. Look - I love it - but we're not there yet. The following needs to be done before I'm taking the re-build sign off.*

* A stunning image carousel | Page: Karro |
* More visual work from previous employments | Page: Visual work |
* Adjustments in padding for project cards | Page: Visual work |
* A cool couple of cards for my LinkedIn recommendations | Page: Reviews |
* A beautiful and clean contact form | Page: Contact | 
* A working footer, it is currently disabled for lack of self discipline | Page: All pages |
* A chatbot pop-up asking if there is anything I can help with | Page: All pages |
